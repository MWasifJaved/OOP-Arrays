# Arrays
   An "array" is a collection of elements of "same data type" stored in "contiguous memory location"
## Why we use Arrays?
  Arrays are used to
 1-Store multiple values in single variable
 2-Easy data management 
 3-Faster access
## Description (Example 1)
    
In this example first we initialize an array and declare it 

### 1-Syntax

 data type[] arrayname;

int[] numbers = {10,20,30,40,50 };

### 2-Accessing elements of Array

    The elements of arrays are accessed by using index numbers.

### Example 
 Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]);    
   //Output: 10

  Now can also access elements of arrays by using loops such as for loops and for each loop.

# Methods in arrays(Examples)

 In this example there are different methods that are used such as "Array.sort" and "Array.max" etc.


## Array.Sort
   "It is used to sort the elements of arrays in accessending order."

### Example
    
   int[] arr = { 5, 3, 1 };
   Array.Sort(arr);
